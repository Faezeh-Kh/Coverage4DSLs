We created a virtual machine using [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and set it up for easy use of the tool on the windows 10 OS.
You can access the virtual machine from [this Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7705853).
Please note that the virtual machine has all the contents for running the tool of this repository (it is on the desktop in a folder named `Coverage4DSLs`).

# Setup
1. Run the Gemoc Studio using the icon pinned to the taskbar or by searching it.

2.	It asks for a workspace, either select an existing workspace or a new folder, then select `Launch`.

The workspace has all the required projects and a run configuration is already set up.

# Usage
Please refer to the README file of the tool: https://github.com/Faezeh-Kh/Coverage4DSLs/blob/main/README.md#usage
