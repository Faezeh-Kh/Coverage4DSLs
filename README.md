# Coverage for xDSLs
This repository contains the evaluation data for our submission to ISSTA 2022 conference as follows:
- *xDSLs_Implementation*: The implementations of the considered xDSLs, including xFSM, xArduino, xPSSM, and xMiniJava. 
We reused the implementation of xPSSM from [here](https://github.com/tetrabox/examples-behavioral-interface/tree/master/languages/statemachines), and the xMiniJava from [here](https://github.com/tetrabox/minijava)), both updated to be compatible with the current version (3.4.0) of the [Gemoc studio](https://gemoc.org/download.html).
- *xDSLs_MutationOperators*: A set of mutation operators defined for each xDSL using [WODEL tool](https://gomezabajo.github.io/Wodel/).
- *xModels&Tests*: A set of models conforming to each xDSL, a test suite for each xModel, the execution result and the computed coverage for each test suite.
- *MutationAnalysis&SBFL*: The generated mutants for each xModel (generated by [WODEL tool](https://gomezabajo.github.io/Wodel/) using the defined mutation operators), and the suspiciousness-based ranking of the elements of each mutant (as Excel files)
- *Data4CodeCover*: the equivalent java implementation of the xMiniJava models (taken from [here](https://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/#programs)), and the JUnit tests corresponding to the xMiniJava tests. This data is used to compute the statement coverage of the JUnit tests with [CodeCover](http://codecover.org/index.html) tool.
